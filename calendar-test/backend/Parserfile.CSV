At Atlanta Contemporary, Klimchak has revived the series in a minimalist compact form, while retaining the improvised format. For the Ear Pollen Series, Pt 2, Klimchak is performing in a series of duets, each month with a different partner and featuring different instruments. In many ways, the duet is the perfect vehicle for improvisation, as it allows the performers to treat their playing as a form of conversation, introducing new ideas, batting those ideas back and forth and taking them to new places to keep the dialog flowing. Part 2 becomes a 2 part conversation for the audience to witness and enjoy.",Georgia,Atlanta,5092024

Advertising the technological optimism of big agriculture, the sampled footage and audio betray the myth of agricultural systems geared towards ever-increasing production and yield rather than equitable distribution. Retrospectively, the videos function as a reality check to the solutions they once proclaimed. The artwork’s title emphasizes the reality of food waste, referencing the USDA’s own damning estimate that 30–40% of food in the US is wasted. The presentation of the video clips in a repetitive grid formation advanced by continuous clicking amplifies the redundancies built into the process of automation. Jules Faife’s accompanying music drives the narrative and pulls the viewer into it, but ?n??ha also works against the score and archival audio, breaking up their momentum by inserting the question “How the Hell is That Progress, Man?” Documenting the demographics of the people working in the fields, at the conveyor belts, and in roles of oversight, the footage openly displays systemic conditions of production and labor. 40% of Food in the US is Wasted (How the Hell is That Progress, Man?) continues ?n??ha’s practice of interrogating and exposing the internal logics of technology-driven progress.",Georgia,Atlanta,5092024

Presenting as a skeletonized human heart, the frame houses a pulsing luminous core that throws shadows of varying intensity across space. The light bulb’s fluctuations, though seemingly random, are a visual manifestation of the artist’s actual pulse, captured and translated in real-time from a networked sensor connected to the artist’s body for the duration of the exhibition. Although the triggers behind the fluctuations captured by the sensor will remain unknown to the audience, the sensor allows Untitled (Pulse) to exist as an embodied entity: a subjective data performance powered by an intimate abstraction of the artist’s physical and emotional state to make obvious the human behind the tech, running in parallel with a physical object made by contemporary technologies with lineages to resource extraction and human exploitation – such as the sensor’s own lithium battery, a technology that promises sustainable energy at the cost of the environmental, health, and human toll inflicted on miners in the Congo. These abstractions attempt to underscore the ever-present human element and impact intrinsically linked to technology, inviting reflection on the prevailing assumption of tech objectivity, the consequences of obscuring humanity from tech, and who slips through the cracks when we uncritically accept technology to be a neutral actor.",Georgia,Atlanta,5092024

Stephanie Dinkins’ Conversations with Bina48 addresses this question through a series of recorded conversations with one of the world’s most advanced social robots –– Bina48 (Breakthrough Intelligence via Neural Architecture 48 exaflops per second). Developed by the Terasem Movement Foundation, Bina48 employs customized artificial intelligence algorithms paired with microphones, video cameras, voice recognition software, and facial recognition software to develop independent thoughts and emotions based on data supplied by visitor dialogue. Working on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence, the Terasem Movement Foundation researches ways to transfer the consciousness of a living person to a machine. Bina48 was created to mimic the appearance and consciousness of the creator’s wife, an African American woman named Bina. Despite the brown rubber skin that covers the android, the robotics team that created Bina48 were primarily white men. The irony of white scientists creating a cyborgian Black woman is underscored in Dinkins conversations with Bina48 and the glitches that occur when Bina48 is faced with a living, breathing, African American woman. In their decade of conversations, Dinkins and Bina48 have discussed family, prejudice, faith, love, and death; conjuring a dialogue that is at times humorous and absurd, and other times, philosophical and deeply unnerving. Conversations with Bina48 explores the bounds of human consciousness, interrogating what separates man from machine, and highlighting the potential that technology enables to exist beyond our corporeal selves.",Georgia,Atlanta,5092024
